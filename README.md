# Welcome to my Github page!
My name is **Scott Burwell, PhD** and I am located in Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA ðŸ—º. I have 15+ years experience researching human behavior, with a focus in impulsive and compulsive actions (e.g., addictions) and the brain physiology that underlies them. I was trained at the [University of Minnesota Center for Twin and Family Research](https://mctfr.psych.umn.edu/) and the [Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience at UC San Diego](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/). I look forward to collaborating on projects relating to mental and behavioral health ðŸ§ , digital therapeutics ðŸ¤³, and physiological monitoring ðŸ©».
